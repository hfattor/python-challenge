<h1>PyBank</h1>
With data imported from a .csv file, this Python script 
reads through the dates that the bank data was updated 
and the profit/loss recorded for that day.

Accounting for a header in the .csv file, the script ouputs:
- the number of months in the list
- the total profit/loss during the timeframe
- the average profit/loss change during the timeframe
- the month that saw the greatest increase in profits (and the profit)
- the month that saw the greatest loss in profits (and the loss)

<h1>PyPoll</h2>
With data imported from a .csv file, this Python script
reads through individual voter IDs and their choice of 
candidate.

Accounting for a header in the .csv file and columns that list the voter ID,
county where the voter voted from, and the candidate name, 
the script outputs:
- the total number of votes cast
- the name of each candidate, the percent of the vote that they received, and the total number of votes they received
- the winner of the poll
